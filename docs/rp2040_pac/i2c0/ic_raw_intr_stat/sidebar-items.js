initSidebarItems({"enum":[["ACTIVITY_A","This bit captures DW_apb_i2c activity and stays set until it is cleared. There are four ways to clear it: - Disabling the DW_apb_i2c - Reading the IC_CLR_ACTIVITY register - Reading the IC_CLR_INTR register - System reset Once this bit is set, it stays set unless one of the four methods is used to clear it. Even if the DW_apb_i2c module is idle, this bit remains set until cleared, indicating that there was activity on the bus."],["GEN_CALL_A","Set only when a General Call address is received and it is acknowledged. It stays set until it is cleared either by disabling DW_apb_i2c or when the CPU reads bit 0 of the IC_CLR_GEN_CALL register. DW_apb_i2c stores the received data in the Rx buffer."],["MASTER_ON_HOLD_A","Indicates whether master is holding the bus and TX FIFO is empty. Enabled only when I2C_DYNAMIC_TAR_UPDATE=1 and IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN=1."],["RD_REQ_A","This bit is set to 1 when DW_apb_i2c is acting as a slave and another I2C master is attempting to read data from DW_apb_i2c. The DW_apb_i2c holds the I2C bus in a wait state (SCL=0) until this interrupt is serviced, which means that the slave has been addressed by a remote master that is asking for data to be transferred. The processor must respond to this interrupt and then write the requested data to the IC_DATA_CMD register. This bit is set to 0 just after the processor reads the IC_CLR_RD_REQ register."],["RESTART_DET_A","Indicates whether a RESTART condition has occurred on the I2C interface when DW_apb_i2c is operating in Slave mode and the slave is being addressed. Enabled only when IC_SLV_RESTART_DET_EN=1."],["RX_DONE_A","When the DW_apb_i2c is acting as a slave-transmitter, this bit is set to 1 if the master does not acknowledge a transmitted byte. This occurs on the last byte of the transmission, indicating that the transmission is done."],["RX_FULL_A","Set when the receive buffer reaches or goes above the RX_TL threshold in the IC_RX_TL register. It is automatically cleared by hardware when buffer level goes below the threshold. If the module is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0]=0), the RX FIFO is flushed and held in reset; therefore the RX FIFO is not full. So this bit is cleared once the IC_ENABLE bit 0 is programmed with a 0, regardless of the activity that continues."],["RX_OVER_A","Set if the receive buffer is completely filled to IC_RX_BUFFER_DEPTH and an additional byte is received from an external I2C device. The DW_apb_i2c acknowledges this, but any data bytes received after the FIFO is full are lost. If the module is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0]=0), this bit keeps its level until the master or slave state machines go into idle, and when ic_en goes to 0, this interrupt is cleared."],["RX_UNDER_A","Set if the processor attempts to read the receive buffer when it is empty by reading from the IC_DATA_CMD register. If the module is disabled (IC_ENABLE[0]=0), this bit keeps its level until the master or slave state machines go into idle, and when ic_en goes to 0, this interrupt is cleared."],["START_DET_A","Indicates whether a START or RESTART condition has occurred on the I2C interface regardless of whether DW_apb_i2c is operating in slave or master mode."],["STOP_DET_A","Indicates whether a STOP condition has occurred on the I2C interface regardless of whether DW_apb_i2c is operating in slave or master mode."],["TX_ABRT_A","This bit indicates if DW_apb_i2c, as an I2C transmitter, is unable to complete the intended actions on the contents of the transmit FIFO. This situation can occur both as an I2C master or an I2C slave, and is referred to as a 'transmit abort'. When this bit is set to 1, the IC_TX_ABRT_SOURCE register indicates the reason why the transmit abort takes places."],["TX_EMPTY_A","The behavior of the TX_EMPTY interrupt status differs based on the TX_EMPTY_CTRL selection in the IC_CON register. - When TX_EMPTY_CTRL = 0: This bit is set to 1 when the transmit buffer is at or below the threshold value set in the IC_TX_TL register. - When TX_EMPTY_CTRL = 1: This bit is set to 1 when the transmit buffer is at or below the threshold value set in the IC_TX_TL register and the transmission of the address/data from the internal shift register for the most recently popped command is completed. It is automatically cleared by hardware when the buffer level goes above the threshold. When IC_ENABLE[0] is set to 0, the TX FIFO is flushed and held in reset. There the TX FIFO looks like it has no data within it, so this bit is set to 1, provided there is activity in the master or slave state machines. When there is no longer any activity, then with ic_en=0, this bit is set to 0."],["TX_OVER_A","Set during transmit if the transmit buffer is filled to IC_TX_BUFFER_DEPTH and the processor attempts to issue another I2C command by writing to the IC_DATA_CMD register. When the module is disabled, this bit keeps its level until the master or slave state machines go into idle, and when ic_en goes to 0, this interrupt is cleared."]],"type":[["ACTIVITY_R","Reader of field `ACTIVITY`"],["GEN_CALL_R","Reader of field `GEN_CALL`"],["MASTER_ON_HOLD_R","Reader of field `MASTER_ON_HOLD`"],["R","Reader of register IC_RAW_INTR_STAT"],["RD_REQ_R","Reader of field `RD_REQ`"],["RESTART_DET_R","Reader of field `RESTART_DET`"],["RX_DONE_R","Reader of field `RX_DONE`"],["RX_FULL_R","Reader of field `RX_FULL`"],["RX_OVER_R","Reader of field `RX_OVER`"],["RX_UNDER_R","Reader of field `RX_UNDER`"],["START_DET_R","Reader of field `START_DET`"],["STOP_DET_R","Reader of field `STOP_DET`"],["TX_ABRT_R","Reader of field `TX_ABRT`"],["TX_EMPTY_R","Reader of field `TX_EMPTY`"],["TX_OVER_R","Reader of field `TX_OVER`"]]});
